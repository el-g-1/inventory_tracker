This is a demo project to track inventory.

This product demonstrates basic CRUD functionality:

In addition, it supports the following:

* Ability to create “shipments” and assign inventory to the shipment, and adjust inventory appropriately

## Prerequisites

To install dependencies:

* `cd` into the project's root directory (where setup.py is located)
* run: `python setup.py install`

## Usage
